Hello, my name is Drew Rakers and I am a senior here at Murray State. I came here my junior year after 
getting my associates degree from a community college called Kaskaskia. I played baseball there but
decided to focus on my career after graduating. I live in Southern Illinois close to St. Louis and have always lived there.
